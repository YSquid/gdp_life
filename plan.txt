0 - understand data: do all countries have the same years, any missing data?


1 - Create a scatter of life expectancy (x) vs GDP (y) for every country
 - Start with one year per country
 - seperate the years for each country with hue perhaps

2 - Use linear regression to come up with an r value and slope for each countries scatter
    - start with the one year
    - loop to get it for all years
    - analyze the r values and slopes - i.e. how linear are relationsips, and how strongly correlated
